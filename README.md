# Healthcare-Information-Management-System

__Healthcare Information Management System (HIMS)__ is an application created as a DBMS project for one of our institute's courses on database management systems. The __HIMS__ application can be used by hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers to manage data/records for patients, doctors, prescriptions, medical tests, and various departments within the healthcare facility. Besides the basic DBMS functionalities such as addition, deletion, update, and search, other useful features are also present in this application.
